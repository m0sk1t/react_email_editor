This problem does not impact ASAP because Safari 6.0 supports\n// mutation observers, so that implementation is used instead.\n// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around\n// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.\n\n// `setTimeout` does not call the passed callback if the delay is less than\n// approximately 7 in web workers in Firefox 8 through 18, and sometimes not\n// even then.\n\nfunction makeRequestCallFromTimer(callback) {\n    return function requestCall() {\n        // We dispatch a timeout with a specified delay of 0 for engines that\n        // can reliably accommodate that request. This will usually be snapped\n        // to a 4 milisecond delay, but once we're flushing, there's no delay\n        // between events.\n        var timeoutHandle = setTimeout(handleTimer, 0);\n        // However, since this timer gets frequently dropped in Firefox\n        // workers, we enlist an interval handle that will try to fire\n        // an event 20 times per second until it succeeds.\n        var intervalHandle = setInterval(handleTimer, 50);\n\n        function handleTimer() {\n            // Whichever timer succeeds will cancel both timers and\n            // execute the callback.\n            clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\n            clearInterval(intervalHandle);\n            callback();\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n// This is for `asap.js` only.\n// Its name will be periodically randomized to break any code that depends on\n// its existence.\nrawAsap.makeRequestCallFromTimer = makeRequestCallFromTimer;\n\n// ASAP was originally a nextTick shim included in Q. This was factored out\n// into this ASAP package. It was later adapted to RSVP which made further\n// amendments. These decisions, particularly to marginalize MessageChannel and\n// to capture the MutationObserver implementation in a closure, were integrated\n// back into ASAP proper.\n//
